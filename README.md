# DeCal Course: Hardware Makers

Access to small and inexpensive computing hardware, sensors, actuators, and batteries has opened new and affordable opportunities for makers to create prototypes for their hardware ideas. This introductory course will expose students to the hardware knowledge necessary to make things. What things? Things that students may want to do with wifi/bluetooth connections of available boards, sensors/actuators, and additional electronics components. Please read the [course syllabus](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jpduarte/resources/DeCalCourseHardwareMakers.pdf) for more details.
