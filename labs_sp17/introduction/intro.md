# Introduction

This week we are going to make sure we are all set up in terms of software and hardware (at least with a prototype board) so we can go smoothly through the semester. This would be (probably) the most stressful week, please be patient, we can do it!

Most of the software that I am indicating to download and install are suggestions. Feel free to use the software that you think is the best for you, and let us know why then we can all learn from it.

## Create github account

We will do a lot of file sharing (not just code!) during this semester, we will try to use github to share files and to be as organized as possible. Using your educational email (It is ok to use another email, but using an .edu you can have private repositories) create a github account in this [link](https://github.com/). Once you are set with your github account, you can request a [github education plan](https://education.github.com/), this takes a while to get approved, better you do it soon.

If you are using Mac or Windows, you can download a [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) that will help you with the organization of files. Linux users only need to use line command. I strongly recommend you to try to use Linux, for example an Ubuntu distribution, while dealing with hardware and prototyping board, Linux is always much much reliable and simpler.

## Software needed

Although the focus of this course is on hardware, we will need to use a lot of software as well. There are several installations that we need to do so we can run them on our computers and use them to communicate with hardware as well.

### Installing IPython
You can install IPython following the same instructions as in [EE16A IPython installation](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/fa15/installation.html).

### Python libraries
For some labs, we will need to use [serial communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJZOTtwpAjA) to connect computers with hardware. In order to do this with Python, please install [pyserial](http://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial.html).

Another library that we will need is [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub). Using this library we can play different sound formats in python and make some fun and simple [projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkmSmyyr30) with it. Please be aware that pydub has some dependences, you will need [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) or libav. In addition, you may need to install [pyaudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/).
