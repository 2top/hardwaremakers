# Introduction

This week we are going to make sure we are all set up in terms of software and hardware (at least with a prototype board) so we can go smoothly through the semester. This would be (probably) the most stressfull week, please be pacient, we can do it!

## Software needed

Although the focus of this course is on hardware, we will need to use a lot of software as well. There are several installations that we need to do so we can run them on our computers and use them to communicate with hardware as well. 

### Installing IPython 
You can install IPython following the same intrucctions as in [EE16A IPython installation](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee16a/fa15/installation.html).

### Python libraries
For some labs, we will need to use [cerial communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJZOTtwpAjA) to connect computers with hardware. In order to do this with Python, please instal [pyserial](http://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial.html). 

Another library that we will need is [pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub). Using this library we can play different sound formats in python and make some fun and simple [projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPkmSmyyr30) with it. Please be aware that pydub has some dependencis, you will need [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org/) or libav. In addition, you may need to install [pyaudio](https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/).
